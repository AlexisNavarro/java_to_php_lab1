# java_to_php_lab1
## Purpose 
For this lab, I had to translate Java code into PHP under a week. This lab challenges my adaptability to learn PHP in a short time notice and how new ways on how to fix bugs that were accidentally and purposely given in the JAVA code 

Many of the difficulties that I have encountered was that I was using an older version of PHP (7.4) which didn't support enumeration for the [Token_Type.php](https://github.com/AlexisNavarro/java_to_php_lab1/blob/main/TokenType.php) file which made me find a work around. Aside from that many of the errors I encountered were syntax errors in PHP since this was the first time I worked in depth with this language. To end it off I had to edit the text file given to me since there would be issues with the spacing such as given me a null value when I read from the file. 

fFr an in depth explanation please read my [Assignment 1 report.docx](https://github.com/AlexisNavarro/java_to_php_lab1/blob/main/Assignment%201%20report.docx) document which has a list of issues and fixes I made
